## Deprecation

**This repository will no longer be actively developed. For more details, please read: [AIsBreaker API is Now Deprecated - We Recommend Using LangChain Instead](https://aisbreaker.org/blog/2024-09-08-aisbreaker-api-deprecation-langchain-recommendation)**


## Introduction

This repo contains the example application [`AIsBreakerSimpleChat.java`](src/main/java/org/aisbreaker/example/AIsBreakerSimpleChat.java) for
using package `org.aisbreaker:aisbreaker-api-java` in a Java application.

[AIsBreaker.org](https://aisbreaker.org/) offers a developer-friendly API for streamlined access to a variety of generative AI services, including OpenAI/ChatGPT, all Hugging Face AIs, Google Gemini AI, and more ... to provide simplicity and to avoid vendor lock-in.

This example is build with [gradle](https://gradle.org/), but other build tools like [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) could be used as well.
